    <p id="p2p1">Welcome! This page aims to inform you on the lore and mythos behind the Willard
	 world. We intend to do our best summary of the icon wars, the landing of element 5, and
	dimension 74 and how it's residents know of the existence of a lovecraftian being 
	watching over them. We also aim to summarize who Willard is and what makes him so 
	powerful.</p><br>

    <p id="p2p2">Our journey begins in the first novel <em>The Silver Blade, </em> when the 
	first meteor containing element 5 (which we later learned was sent back there in the
	fourth movie, but that's besides the point.) lands and the medieval scientists
	(called the "Followers of Bacon") start working on a device to plug element 5's
	 regenerative abilities into a human (see "Element 5 matter effects on blood tissue"
	from the in-universe explination novel <em>The Lost Journals.</em>)</p><br>
